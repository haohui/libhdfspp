/**
\mainpage libhdfs++

libhdfs++ is a modern implementation of HDFS client in C++11. It is
optimized for the Massive Parallel Processing (MPP) applications that
access thousands of files concurrently in HDFS.

libhdfs++ is built on top of an event-driven architecture. It
expresses the HDFS protocols with \link hdfs::monad::Monad \endlink for
maintainability.
